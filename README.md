# BatAdv - Batch-adventure

An attempt to write a text adventure using batch in MS-DOS (5, I think).
Written in 1998 as a programming challenge against some classmates.

I thought it was lost, but I found an old version (unsure if it is the latest version), so I thought I'd better curate it in GitHub, before I lose it again!

I have no idea what is the current state. 

Some things I do remember:
- there was some nifty ANSI escape sequence magic in it, including remapping of arrow keys to navigate with.
- at the same time I struggled with lots of Batch basics that either didn't exist, or I didn't know of, like string input, calculations, nested blocks and many other things that could have made this a lot easier.
- locations/scenes/rooms were separate directories, and could fairly easily be added to the game map. Each location had it's own implementation, tied together by a thin 'game engine'.
- objects were files. Picking up an object was a matter of moving it from a location folder to the inventory folder.
- there is a menu that allows you to escape to the command prompt or start an editor, so you can basically do in-game editing and debugging.
- there is no story. I don't know how to write game stories. I really don't.
